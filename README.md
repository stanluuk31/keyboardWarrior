# KEYBOARD WARRIOR
This is one of my projects, this is build together with first year students, I was the only second year. I could not use OOP but I think we managed to built something cool, most of the logic in the main is written by me and I structured the code and files as well

# How to play
to run, run 
```poetry install```
then:
```poetry run python main.py```

# The game
It is based on pokemon, written in Blessed,
The user has to type in the name of the attack as fast as possible to infilct damage to enemy, 
the enemy also inflicts damage on the user randomly, with random damage and some enemies are harder.
